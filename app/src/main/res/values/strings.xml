    <string name="about_content">
        This game is a blackjack variant that provides the player with power-ups to balance against
        the implicit edge of the dealer. A list and explanation of each power-up can be found in
        the "How to Play" section. I hope you have fun playing the game!

    <string name="incineration_str">

        Change your hand entirely. Be careful - you can only swap hands before you hit or stand!
